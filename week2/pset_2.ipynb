    "In this exercise, we will study a theory for how the visual system might learn to represent visual information. The visual system must extract useful information from the complex and highly redundant visual input it receives. The receptive fields of simple cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) can be characterized as being spatially localized, oriented, and bandpass. This means that simple cells are sensitive to visual stimuli presented at a specific location and orientation in the visual field. They are also selective for a range of spatial frequencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to understand response properties of visual neurons by considering their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding. To accomplish this, we will consider that the visual system learns a \"sparse code\" for natural images. A sparse code is one in which only a small number of neurons in V1 are active at any given time, meaning that the neurons only respond to certain features or patterns in the image.\n",

    "The presented results show that the sparse model learns to extract simple features from natural images, these receptive fields are similar to the receptive fields of simple cells in the visual cortex. The model provides a plausible explanation for how the visual system might learn to represent complex visual information with a relatively small number of neurons. The result suggests that this type of sparse coding may be a general principle of sensory processing in the brain.\n",
